# Movie review classifier



Following the algorithm described in Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis(https://aclanthology.org/P11-1015/), I plan to build a movie review classifier web application. This movie review web application will let the user to input a paragraph of review and the application will try to judge whether this paragraph is a positive review or a negative review. This task is interesting and can be used in several applications. It can be used by movie review websites like Rotten Tomatoes to automatically recognize and classify users’ reviews.
