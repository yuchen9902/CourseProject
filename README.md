# Movie review classifier



Following the algorithm described in Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis(https://aclanthology.org/P11-1015/), I plan to build a movie review classifier web application. This movie review web application will let the user to input a paragraph of review and the application will try to judge whether this paragraph is a positive review or a negative review. This task is interesting and can be used in several applications. It can be used by movie review websites like Rotten Tomatoes to automatically recognize and classify usersâ€™ reviews.
